    <br><br>
    The provider of the pages automatically collects and stores information in

    <br><br>
    used operating system

    Time of the server request
    <br><br>
    IP address
    <br><br>
    A merge of this data with other data sources will not be done.
    <br><br>

    form, including the contact details you provided there, will be stored in
    order to process the request and in case of follow-up questions. We will not
    share this information without your consent.
    <br><br>
    The processing of the data entered into the contact form is therefore
    exclusively based on your consent (Art. 6 (1) lit. DSGVO). You can revoke
    this consent at any time. An informal message by e-mail to us is sufficient.
    The legality of the data processing operations carried out until the
    revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.
    <br><br>
    The information you provide in the contact form will remain with us until
    you ask us to delete it, revoke your consent to storage or delete the
    purpose for data storage (for example, after your request has been
    processed). Mandatory statutory provisions - especially retention periods -
    remain unaffected. In the database of the application, the contact requests
    are automatically deleted after 60 days.

    Google Web Fonts
    <br><br>
    This site uses so-called web fonts, provided by Google, for the uniform
    representation of fonts. When you call up a page, your browser loads the
    required web fonts into your browser cache to display texts and fonts
    correctly.
    <br>
    <br>
    To do this, the browser you use must connect to Google's servers. As a
    result, Google learns that our website has been accessed via your IP
    address. The use of Google Web Fonts is in the interest of a consistent and
    attractive presentation of our online services. This constitutes a
    legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO. If
    your browser does not support web fonts, a default font will be used by your
    computer.
